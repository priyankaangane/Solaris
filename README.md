# Solaris AI Co-Pilot

## Inspiration

The MICROSOFT AI LEARNING HACKATHON was an exciting opportunity to contribute to something innovative - an AI co-pilot to assist users.

## What It Does

The co-pilot leverages AI technologies to provide intelligent responses and user support. It integrates advanced AI functionalities to create a responsive and helpful assistant.

## How I Built It

I began by immersing myself in understanding AI technologies, database management, and exploring Azure services like Cosmos DB and OpenAI. Watching YouTube videos and taking extensive notes helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of these topics. Key steps included:

- **Provisioning Azure Resources:** Set up necessary resources on Azure.
- **Database Setup:** Pivoted from Azure Cosmos DB to MongoDB Atlas due to free tier limitations.
- **AI Integration:** Integrated Azure OpenAI services using provided API keys and endpoints.
- **Development:** Used Flask for backend API, JavaScript for frontend, and Azure Proxy Playground for testing.
- **Experimentation:** Fine-tuned the co-pilot's capabilities through continuous coding and testing.

## Challenges I Ran Into

- **Azure Cosmos DB Limitations:** Overcame by switching to MongoDB Atlas.
- **Accessing Azure OpenAI Services:** Resolved by utilizing provided API keys and endpoints.
- **Resource Constraints:** Managed efficiently to complete the project within the hackathon timeline.

## Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of

- Successfully integrating AI technologies and database solutions into a functional co-pilot.
- Overcoming technical challenges and completing the project within the hackathon timeline.

## What I Learned

The hackathon provided invaluable insights into:

- **AI Technologies:** Deepened my understanding of AI concepts and their practical applications.
- **Database Management:** Enhanced my skills in efficient data handling and optimization with MongoDB Atlas and Azure Cosmos DB.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Strengthened my ability to innovate and find effective solutions under pressure.

## What's Next for Solaris

- **Continuous Improvement:** Committed to refining Solaris, enhancing its functionality and user experience.
- **Exploration of New Technologies:** Eager to explore cutting-edge AI advancements to further empower Solaris.
- **Community Engagement:** Engaging with users and the developer community to drive ongoing enhancements and ensure Solaris meets evolving needs effectively.

This hackathon was just the beginning of Solaris's journey toward becoming a robust AI co-pilot, and I look forward to its future evolution and impact.
